# RainbowLock
The application works as follows. If the user selects four colors in order like Red, Green, Blue   and Yellow, 
and the priority has chosen like 1, 2, 3, 4 respectively if we give respective numbers   
to respective colors then the app will be opened and when we close it and open again 
the colors order will be changed so the numbers for the colors are also changed.
